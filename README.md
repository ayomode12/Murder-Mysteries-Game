# murder_mystery_coursework

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
About the Project

This project was my first foray into Flutter development. The goal was to create an engaging and interactive decision-making game that showcases core Flutter concepts, such as state management, dynamic UI, and integration with Firebase. The game brings to life a murder mystery, where every decision affects the story progression and ultimately leads to solving the caseâ€”or not.

Players can choose between two gripping storylines:

The Politician's Demise: A high-stakes scenario where a prominent politician is found dead, and all household members are suspects.
The Tragedy on the Balcony: A tale of betrayal and deceit where a young woman is mysteriously killed during a gathering of friends.
Features

Interactive Gameplay:
Players navigate through a series of nodes, each presenting a choice that affects the progression of the storyline.
Multiple Endings:
Correctly identifying the killer leads to victory, while incorrect guesses provide an opportunity to retry.
Dynamic Story Progression:
Each choice dynamically updates the game's visuals and narrative.
Firebase Integration:
Data is stored in Firebase Firestore for scalability and real-time updates.
Cross-Platform:
The game is designed to run seamlessly on Android, iOS, and Web platforms.
